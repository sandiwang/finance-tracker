# Personal Finance Tracker

A place where you keep track of monthly/yearly expense and deposit. It gives you breakdown of transactions for a better understand of the money you are spending. It is lightweight but it's all you ever need.

## Story Behind

The reason I wanted to create this app is because I couldn't find the right expense tracker on the market that suits what I need, want, and like. There's always something not right for me when using them. I only need some basic functionality. I don't need a lot of fancy things, but it definitely has to be "enough" for me to know what's happening every month in tons of transaction I have. Therefore, this was born.
